Securimage-WP-REG adds captcha ptotection from Securimage-WP plugin on register pages.


== Description ==

[Securimage-WP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/securimage-wp/) utilizes the powerful CAPTCHA protection of [Securimage Captcha](http://phpcaptcha.org/ "Securimage PHP CAPTCHA") to add protection to your WordPress comment forms.    

Unfortunately, it didn't have option to be installed on user register page. Now you can just install Securimage-WP-REG, enable it - and you will have CAPTCHA on register page!    

Securimage-WP-REG adds captcha on register pages and fixes one little bug of Securimage-WP. I hope it will be fixed in future and I added option for it.
